# Zscaler MCP Server: Bringing Unified Security Automation to Your AI Agents

It feels like everywhere you look, people are talking about the Model Context Protocol (MCP)‚Äîthe new standard for connecting AI agents and applications to real-world tools and APIs. MCP is quickly becoming the bridge that lets large language models (LLMs) and coding assistants do more than just answer questions: it lets them take action, automate workflows, and interact with your environment in powerful new ways.

But until now, most MCP servers have been limited to local, developer-focused setups. What if you could bring the full power of Zscaler's security cloud ZCC, ZDX, ZIA, and ZPA right to your favorite AI agent, with a single, unified, open-source server? That's exactly what we've built.

Today, we're excited to announce the preview version of **Zscaler MCP Server**, an open-source solution that brings the full power of Zscaler's security platform directly to your AI agents and automation workflows. Whether you're using Claude Desktop, Cursor, VS Code with Copilot, or any other MCP-compatible client, you can now manage your entire Zscaler environment through natural language conversations and automated workflows.

## ¬ªZscaler's vision for MCP servers

At Zscaler, we view Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers as an essential bridge connecting enterprise security infrastructure with the rapidly evolving AI landscape. By leveraging standardized protocols like MCP, we can create secure, traceable interactions between AI agents and security systems, ensuring that security automation relies on trustworthy, up-to-date data and robust enterprise security policies ‚Äî rather than just probabilistic assumptions.

As AI capabilities continue to advance, enterprises will increasingly expect these intelligent agents to perform critical security operations such as threat mitigation, policy management, or automated incident response. These operations, however, must be executed within a framework that enterprises can rely on and that upholds the zero-trust security principles essential to modern organizations. This is precisely where the Zscaler MCP Server plays its role: It empowers security professionals, developers, and platform teams to engage with Zscaler's integrated security platform through natural language and AI-driven interactions, enabling them to complete security tasks efficiently while maintaining security, compliance, and full auditability.

The Zscaler MCP Server maintains LLM neutrality, giving organizations the flexibility to leverage their existing AI investments and preferred LLMs, while security practitioners can choose the tools that best suit their workflow. Whether integrating with Claude, GPT, or any other MCP-compatible AI solution, the server delivers a uniform, secure gateway to your Zscaler environment.









 

## ¬ªWhat is the Zscaler MCP Server?

The Zscaler MCP Server is a Python-based, open-source application that exposes Zscaler's core services through a unified, MCP-compliant API. It's designed to be the missing link between your AI-powered agents and the full suite of Zscaler APIs, enabling seamless integration between your security infrastructure and modern AI workflows.



**Why is this a big deal?**  
With the Zscaler MCP Server, you can:
- **Automate security operations**: Across all Zscaler products from a single endpoint
- **Integrate with AI assistants**: To manage your environment using natural language
- **Orchestrate complex, cross-product workflows**: No more juggling multiple APIs or dashboards
- **Choose your API framework**: The MCP server can be configured to use either the new Zscaler OneAPI framework or the legacy API framework, depending on your organization's requirements

**Key highlights:**
- **Unified API**: Access Zscaler Client Connector (ZCC), Digital Experience (ZDX), Internet Access (ZIA), and Private Access (ZPA) from one place
- **Dual API Framework Support**: Full compatibility with both the new Zscaler OneAPI framework and the legacy API framework
- **Open Source & Extensible**: Released on GitHub for the community to use, extend, and contribute to
- **Powered by the Official Zscaler Python SDK**: All functionality is built on top of the [zscaler-sdk-python](https://github.com/zscaler/zscaler-sdk-python), ensuring reliability, security, and full compatibility with Zscaler's APIs

## ¬ªWorks Seamlessly With Your Favorite AI Agents

The Zscaler MCP Server is designed and tested to work with the most popular AI-powered agents and developer tools, including:

- **Claude Desktop** ([claude.ai](https://claude.ai/)): Interact with your Zscaler environment using natural language prompts. The server appears in Claude's tools list, enabling you to run queries like "List ZPA Segment Groups" or "List ZIA Rule Labels" directly from chat.

- **Cursor** ([cursor.so](https://cursor.so/)): Integrate the MCP server as a tool in Cursor's "Agent Mode" for code and security automation.

- **Visual Studio Code** ([VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)): Use with GitHub Copilot's Agent Mode to automate Zscaler tasks from your code editor.

- **Other MCP-compatible clients**: The server is built to the MCP standard, so it can be integrated with any client that supports MCP.

Getting started is easy‚Äîjust follow the configuration steps in the [README](./README.md) for your preferred agent.







## ¬ªFlexible Deployment: Docker or Local Install

You can run the Zscaler MCP Server however you like, and regardless of your deployment method, you have the flexibility to use either the new OneAPI authentication or the legacy API framework.

### üê≥ **Docker (Recommended for Most Users)**
- **Portability & Isolation**: Run the server in a container for a consistent, dependency-free experience
- **Quick Start**:
  1. Install Docker Desktop
  2. Create a `.env` file with your Zscaler credentials
  3. Build and run the container with `make docker-build`
  4. Configure your MCP client (Claude, Cursor, VS Code, etc.) to connect to the Dockerized server

### üõ†Ô∏è **Local Installation (For Developers & Contributors)**
- **Editable Source**: Clone the repo and install dependencies locally for rapid development and customization
- **Dev Mode**:
  1. Clone the repository
  2. Install dependencies with `uv pip install -e .` or `pip install -r requirements.txt`
  3. Start the server with your preferred MCP client

Both methods are fully documented in the [README](./README.md), including sample configuration files for each supported agent.
